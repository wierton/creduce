-----------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains a few random test cases for C-Reduce. They
aren't particularly portable or interesting, but rather are used as
smoke-tests by the C-Reduce developers.

To run these you must have gcc, clang, frama-c, and kcc in your path.
The last two programs can be found here:

  http://frama-c.com/

  https://code.google.com/p/c-semantics/

Run the tests like this:

  ./run_tests

You can run specific versions of gcc and clang by setting the `GCC'
and `CLANG' environment variables, respectively.
